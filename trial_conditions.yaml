run:
  mode: opt
  time: 60s
  plugins: See ./ILLIXR/Makefile
  system: sam's laptop
  notes:
    - I removed many of the prints, for performance reasons, when built in `opt`.
    - I started compiling OpenVINS with `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` when the rest of ILLIXR is built in `opt`.
  caveats:
    - My laptop is fairly underpowered and has low disk I/O (relevant for `offline_imu_cam`)
    - I don't have ZED, which is a major contributor.
    - I don't have the application timers.
    - I don't distinguish OpenVINS IMU updates from camera updates.
