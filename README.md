- The exact code I used is in [`ILLIXR`](./ILLIXR) (submodule)/.
- An exact copy of the metrics I recovered are available in [`metrics`](./metrics), so this analysis is reproducible.
- Read [`trial_conditions.yaml`](./trial_conditions.yaml) for trial conditions/environment.
- To run the analysis yourself, see [`./analysis/README.md`](./analysis/README.md).
- Read [`output/README.md`](./output/) for interesting things in the output.
