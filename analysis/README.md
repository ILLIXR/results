The graphs and tables in [`../output`](../output) are generated by `main.py`.

I use [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage its dependencies.

To use this script yourself, do

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt install python3.8
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python3.8 10
sudo apt-get install python-pip

# We need dev headers for to compile a certain package
sudo apt-get install -y python3.8-dev

# Install poetry
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python


cd analysis
# Install Python package dependencies
poetry install

poetry run python main.py
```

Only the last line needs to be re-run.
